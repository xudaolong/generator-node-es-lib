# GENERATOR-NODE-ES-LIB
This `yo generation` provides a more complete process for submitting NPM libraries.

# Usage
Provide the following features:

- Use `es6/es7` and use `standard` style
- Use `webpack` to build the release library
  - make build
- Use `docker-compose` to test the any unit case
  - make test
- Auto release to the npm library.

Good lucky.
